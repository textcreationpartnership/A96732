            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>I love no beauty without it.</l>
            <l>In briefe, be what ſhe will I'm one,</l>
            <l>That can love all, but will wed none.</l>

            <l>From ruſt, from ſoile, from fire forever free:</l>
            <l>But if <hi>I</hi> love it, 'tis becauſe its made</l>

            <l>All this in women we might think upon,</l>

            <l>As beauty is not, nor wealth; he that ſtrayes thus</l>
            <l>From her, to hers; is more Adulterous,</l>

            <l>Although we ſee Celeſtial bodies move</l>

            <l>And virtues: but we love the centrique part.</l>
            <l>Nor is the ſoul more worthy, or more fit</l>
            <l>For love then that; as infinite as it.</l>
            <l>But in attaining this deſired place,</l>
            <l>How much they erre, that ſet out at the face?</l>
            <l>The haire a Forreſt is of ambuſhes,</l>
            <l>Of ſprings, ſnares, fetters, and manicles:</l>
            <l>The brow becalms us, when tis ſooth &amp; plain;</l>
            <l>And when tis wrinkled, ſhipwracks us again:</l>
            <l>Smooth, 'tis a Paradiſe, where we would have</l>
            <l>Imortal ſtay: and wrinkled, 'tis our grave.</l>
            <l>The noſe like to the firſt Meridian runs,</l>
            <l>Not twixt an Eaſt, &amp; Weſt; but twixt two ſuns:</l>

            <l>Not faint Canaries; but Ambroſial,</l>
            <l>Her ſwelling lips: to which when we are come</l>
            <l>We anchor there, &amp; think our ſelves at home:</l>
            <l>For they ſing all their Syrens ſongs; &amp; there</l>
            <l>Wiſe <hi>Delphique</hi> Oracles do fill the eare:</l>
            <l>There in a Creek, where choſen Pearles do ſwell</l>
            <l>The Remora; her cleaving tongue doth dwell.</l>
            <l>Thoſe, and the promontary faire, her chinne</l>
            <l>Ore paſt: and the ſtraight Helleſpont, between</l>
            <l>The Seſtos and Abidos of her breaſts;</l>
            <l>(Not of two Lovers, but two loves the neſts)</l>
            <l>Succeeds a boundleſſe Sea; but that thine eye</l>
            <l>Some Iſland moles may ſcattered there diſcry:</l>

            <l>Shall at her faire Atlantique Navel ſtay.</l>

            <l>Thou ſhalt upon another forreſt ſet:</l>
            <l>Where many ſhipwracke: and no farther get</l>
            <l>When thou art there. Conſider well this chace</l>
            <l>Miſpent; by the beginning at the face.</l>
            <l>Rather ſet out below; practice my art,</l>
            <l>Some ſimitry the foot hath with that part</l>
            <l>Which thou doſt ſeek; and is as Map for that;</l>
            <l>Lovely enough to ſtoop, but not ſtay at:</l>
            <l>Leaſt ſubject to diſguiſe, and change it is;</l>
            <l>Men ſay the Devil never can change his:</l>
            <l>It is the Emblem that hath figured</l>
            <l>Firmneſſe; 'tis the firſt part that comes to bed.</l>
            <l>Civility we ſee refin'd; the kiſſe</l>
            <l>Which at the face begun, tranſplanted is</l>
            <l>Since to the hand, ſince to the Imperial knee,</l>
            <l>Now at the papal foot delights to be,</l>
            <l>If Kings think that the nearer way, and do</l>
            <l>Kiſſe from the foot, Lovers may do ſo too.</l>
            <l>For as free Sphears move faſter far than can</l>
            <l>Birds; whom the aire reſiſts: ſo may that man</l>
            <l>Which goes the empty, and Aetherial wayes;</l>
            <l>Then if at beauties elements he ſtayes.</l>
            <l>Rich nature hath in women wiſely made</l>
            <l>Two purſes, and their mouths averſly laid:</l>
            <l>Thus they which to the lower tribute owe,</l>
            <l>That way which that Exchequer looks, muſt go;</l>
            <l>He which doth not, his error is as great,</l>
            <l>As who by gliſter gives the ſtomack meat.</l>
